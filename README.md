# tech-interview-prep

This repo was created to provide my own advice on how to prepare to tech interviews

## Learning the basics

I have no suggestions on how to learn the very basics of the first programming language of your choice. But I just list
a few things you need to know in order to continue with this guide:

- Variables and how to assign them
- Types (the most basic ones like boolean, integer, string, array)
- Basic operators (like addition, multiplication, modulo, string concatenation, logical and / or etc.)
- Conditional logic (if / else statements)
- Loops (and how to iterate through array from start to end and from end to start)
- Functions (a piece of code which could be reused)

It will be nice to get an understanding of what class is, how to create one, how to create an instance of this class and
so on.

## Preparation to algo interview

The best way to prepare to algo interview in my opinion is to solve interview-like problems. The most popular site to do
it is [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). So make sure you have an account there since most of the recommendations below
require it.

### How to solve LeetCode problems

Since preparation to coding interview is mostly about the volume of problems solved and about understanding several
principles we do not need to spend more than 10-15 minutes per problem. If you did not come to any solution or idea to
try - no reason to spend any more time on this. Just try to find any hint or tip which will help you to move forward.

If even that is not enough - feel free to look for a solution and explanation on YouTube. Try to get an idea on how to
solve the problem or even the whole algorithm. But try to avoid copy-pasting a solution. The main goal is to **
understand** the solution and implement it yourself. Even if you are not the one who invented the algorithm.

### Helpful YouTube channels

Here are some useful YouTube channels which could help:

- [Happy Coding](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnIYOzDChH7V8s5BqvjGSEQ) - Great explanation and solution.
- [Timothy H Chang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYN7_u5craa4dZc12Ik2P0g) - Short and concise video solutions.
- [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/NeetCode) - Sometimes overcomplicated but beginner-friendly.
- [LarryNY](https://www.youtube.com/c/Algorithmist) - Real-time solution (without preparation), but a lot of content.

A few more non-beginner-friendly channels of great Competitive Programmers. Just to take a look at how pros could solve
a problem faster than newbie could even read it (;

- [Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/c/Errichto) aka Kamil Debowski
- [tmwilliamlin168](https://www.youtube.com/c/WilliamLin168) aka William Lin

And a few additional links with explanation of some useful concepts and datastructures
(most likely will not be that useful at the very beginning):

- [Alexander Le](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5dsglSe4sYDeN_nULuVg2Q/videos) - very few problems solved with great
  visuals
- [WilliamFiset](https://www.youtube.com/c/WilliamFiset-videos/videos) - great explanation of different concepts (mostly
  graph-related)
- [Ben Langmead](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenLangmead/videos) - just an example of how algorithms could help in
  Biology

### Getting the right mindset

Getting a job offer is a matter of good preparation. So be prepared to spend several weeks or even month on this.
Everyone reading this could do it - just keep the process going.

Solving 1 problem per day for a month is better than solving 30 problems during the first day and doing nothing for the
rest of the month.
**Consistency is key.**

Before trying to get a job offer from a particular company we need to cover the basic data structures and principles.

In order to do so it is recommended to start learning concepts one-by-one.

More to that try follow the algorithm below:

1. Read the problem (including constraints)
2. Understand what exactly need to be done (pen and paper could help)
3. Define several examples (possibly edge cases) of input data and write down the output
4. Write down an algorithm (if you can not do it on your own - use tips or YouTube explanations)
5. Implement it (the first step when you actually need a computer).

Feel free to use IDE on Step 5 if you are new to your programming language. But if you want an interview-like experience
you need to write your solution without IDE in a text editor like notepad. Syntax highlighting is ok for some cases
and [VSCode Online](https://vscode.dev/) could be used here.

Of course, you could use LeetCode editor but please avoid submitting / running incomplete solution just to try it. And
also avoid printing anything to **stdout** for debugging purposes.

You should only **submit a solution you think will work and will be accepted**.

### Building the foundation

It is suggested to start with LeetCode Cards since it has both theory articles and problems to solve.

Ideal situation is to solve the following cards in order. Since some of them have prerequisites.

1. [Arrays 101](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/) - a beginner-friendly card to warm up and to
   get familiar with LeetCode
2. [Array and String](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/) - pay attention to 2-pointer technique
   since it is used not only in array-related problems
3. [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/) - one of the most popular concept in interview
   questions
4. [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/) - quite simple concept which helps to
   learn graph problems and recursion later
5. [Queue and Stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/) - another extremely important data structure
   which need to be learned
6. [Recursion I](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/) - introduction to a concept of recursion and
   memoization
7. [Recursion II](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/) - more advanced concepts like backtracking

### Honing your skills

Once you get the basics you will be able to solve about 20-35% of all the problems. More to that, most likely you will
be able to pass an interview to 3rd or 2nd tier companies.

If that is not enough for you, then let's move on. Below you can find some more links and topics worth learning.

- [Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) - even if you are not planning to become a
  competitive programmer this book is quite helpful to learn some theory and approaches used to solve problems
